1. Introduction
---------------

This  package is  a distribution  of  Emacs Lisp  files implementing  an
editing mode addon for Emacs Lisp under GNU Emacs.  The addon implements
special support for the facilities of the MMUX Emacs packages.

  The library targets POSIX systems.  This package is meant to work with
GNU Emacs version 26+.  This package depends upon the external packages:
cl-lib.  To run the test suite: this package requires the ERT package.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

  The last  time the author  bothered to  update this paragraph,  he had
tested GNU Emacs 26.1.

3. Install
----------

To install the package from a proper release tarball, we must unpack the
archive then do:

   $ cd mmux-emacs-lisp-addon-0.1.0
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-emacs-lisp-addon

  If, instead,  we have checked out  a revision from the  repository, we
will have  to first build the  infrastructure running a script  from the
top source directory:

   $ cd mmux-emacs-lisp-addon
   $ sh autogen.sh

notice that "autogen.sh" will run the program "autoreconf".

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html


A. Credits
----------

This package was written by Marco Maggi, deriving code from the built-in
Scheme mode.
